Create this directory with:\n$# mkdir -pv $LFS/tools Create new group and user:\n$# groupadd lfs $# useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs the user and the group both called lfs\nyou can change lfs to your desired name\n Remind:\n-m : This creates a home directory for lfs.\n-k /dev/null : This parameter prevents possible copying of files from a skeleton directory (default is /etc/skel) by changing the input location to the special null device.\n $# passwd lfs\t#Set New Password Grant lfs full access to all directories under $LFS by making lfs the directory owner:\n$# chown -v lfs $LFS/{usr,lib,var,etc,bin,sbin,tools} $# case $(uname -m) in \u0026gt; x86_64) chown -v lfs $LFS/lib64 ;; \u0026gt; esac If a separate working directory was created as suggested, give user lfs ownership of this directory:\n$# chown -v lfs $LFS/sources Next, login as user lfs. This can be done via a virtual console, through a display manager, or with the following substitute/switch user command:\n$# su - lfs The “-” instructs su to start a login shell as opposed to a non-login shell. The difference between these two types of shells can be found in detail in bash(1) and info bash.\nSet up a good working environment by creating two new startup files for the bash shell. While logged in as user lfs, issue the following command to create a new .bash_profile:\n$ cat \u0026gt; ~/.bash_profile \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;EOF\u0026#34; \u0026gt; exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1=\u0026#39;\\u:\\w\\$ \u0026#39; /bin/bash \u0026gt; EOF When logged on as user lfs, the initial shell is usually a login shell which reads the /etc/profile of the host (probably containing some settings and environment variables) and then .bash_profile. The exec env -i\u0026hellip;/bin/bash command in the .bash_profile file replaces the running shell with a new one with a completely empty environment, except for the HOME, TERM, and PS1 variables. This ensures that no unwanted and potentially hazardous environment variables from the host system leak into the build environment. The technique used here achieves the goal of ensuring a clean environment.\nThe new instance of the shell is a non-login shell, which does not read, and execute, the contents of /etc/profile or .bash_profile files, but rather reads, and executes, the .bashrc file instead. Create the .bashrc file now:\n$ vim .bashrc paste it:\ncat \u0026gt; ~/.bashrc \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;EOF\u0026#34; set +h umask 022 LFS=/mnt/lfs LC_ALL=POSIX LFS_TGT=$(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu PATH=/usr/bin if [ ! -L /bin ]; then PATH=/bin:$PATH; fi PATH=$LFS/tools/bin:$PATH export LFS LC_ALL LFS_TGT PATH EOF then :wq\n Remind:\n  set +h\nThe set +h command turns off bash\u0026rsquo;s hash function. Hashing is ordinarily a useful feature—bash uses a hash table to remember the full path of executable files to avoid searching the PATH time and again to find the same executable. However, the new tools should be used as soon as they are installed. By switching off the hash function, the shell will always search the PATH when a program is to be run. As such, the shell will find the newly compiled tools in $LFS/tools as soon as they are available without remembering a previous version of the same program in a different location.\n  LC_ALL=POSIX\nThe LC_ALL variable controls the localization of certain programs, making their messages follow the conventions of a specified country. Setting LC_ALL to “POSIX” or “C” (the two are equivalent) ensures that everything will work as expected in the chroot environment.\n  LFS_TGT=(uname -m)-lfs-linux-gnu\nThe LFS_TGT variable sets a non-default, but compatible machine description for use when building our cross compiler and linker and when cross compiling our temporary toolchain. More information is contained in Toolchain Technical Notes.\n  PATH=/usr/bin\nMany modern linux distributions have merged /bin and /usr/bin. When this is the case, the standard PATH variable needs just to be set to /usr/bin/ for the Chapter 6 environment. When this is not the case, the following line adds /bin to the path.\n  if [ ! -L /bin ]; then PATH=/bin:$PATH; fi\nIf /bin is not a symbolic link, then it has to be added to the PATH variable.\n  PATH=$LFS/tools/bin:$PATH\nBy putting $LFS/tools/bin ahead of the standard PATH, the cross-compiler installed at the beginning of Chapter 5 is picked up by the shell immediately after its installation. This, combined with turning off hashing, limits the risk that the compiler from the host be used instead of the cross-compiler.\n  export LFS LC_ALL LFS_TGT PATH\n  While the above commands have set some variables, in order to make them visible within any sub-shells, we export them.\n  Important Several commercial distributions add a non-documented instantiation of /etc/bash.bashrc to the initialization of bash. This file has the potential to modify the lfs user\u0026rsquo;s environment in ways that can affect the building of critical LFS packages. To make sure the lfs user\u0026rsquo;s environment is clean, check for the presence of /etc/bash.bashrc and, if present, move it out of the way.\nDo:\n$# [ ! -e /etc/bash.bashrc ] || mv -v /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc.NOUSE\t#root user # or $ [ ! -e /etc/bash.bashrc ] || sudo mv -v /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc.NOUSE\t#using sudo (wheel or sudo group required) After use of the lfs user is finished at the beginning of Chapter 7, you can restore /etc/bash.bashrc (if desired).\nNote that the LFS Bash package we will build in Section 8.34, “Bash-5.0” is not configured to load or execute /etc/bash.bashrc, so this file is useless on a completed LFS system.\n Finally, to have the environment fully prepared for building the temporary tools, source the just-created user profile:\n$ source ~/.bash_profile 4. building the LFS cross toolchain and temporary tools 4  Important The build instructions assume that the Host System Requirements, including symbolic links, have been set properly:\n bash is the shell in use. sh is a symbolic link to bash. /usr/bin/awk is a symbolic link to gawk. /usr/bin/yacc is a symbolic link to bison or a small script that executes bison.  Important To re-emphasize the build process:\n Place all the sources and patches in a directory that will be accessible from the chroot environment such as /mnt/lfs/sources. Change to the sources directory. For each package:  Using the tar program, extract the package to be built. In Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, ensure you are the lfs user when extracting the package. Change to the directory created when the package was extracted. Follow the book\u0026rsquo;s instructions for building the package. Change back to the sources directory. Delete the extracted source directory unless instructed otherwise.

After having breakfast, we went out through the MRT gate and saw a crowd of people surrounding the entire venue. . We walked by the man-made wall and asked a person who was standing in line about the direction of the line. At this moment, it was almost ten o\u0026rsquo;clock in the morning, and we were guided to wait in line outside the main entrance (area 13-D). On the stalled team, friends sat down together, one of them was chasing \u0026ldquo;Goblin Slayer\u0026rdquo;, the others were playing games. During this period, I saw students ordering Foodpanda, workers eating lunch on another shelter, and some cos \u0026ldquo;Re: Life in a Different World from Zero\u0026rdquo; Rem and \u0026ldquo;Wolf Game\u0026rdquo; Iida Rentaro. It took about half an hour before someone gradually moved, and my friends began to prepare to order McDonald\u0026rsquo;s. This is the scene at the time:\n Are there too many people! ! !\n  2 (About an hour later)\nAt that time, I thought that the entrance was the venue, and when I entered:\n You have to row inside! ! !\n Not only that, but the number of people on the second floor gradually increased.\n (There are too many kapok rows, right)\n  3 (After queuing for nearly four hours)\nFinally arrived at the venue. The first thing we entered was not to grab the lucky bag immediately, but to walk around the whole venue first. These were taken while shopping:\n One Piece\n  Compared with Good Smile!\n  Lots of people\n  Hanako-kun! ! ! Hui Ye! ! !\n  I also saw a big drawing board, but unfortunately I didn’t get it\nOf course there must be ghosts, hatsune, JOJO, guinea pigs\nChildren only watch the Blade of Ghost Slayer, adults watch Guinea Pigs\n  4 I walked the whole venue and sat by the wall with my friends. I looked at them for a while and wanted to say why I went to Kapok to buy a slime bag before I started buying a lucky bag. When I came back and waited until my friend started to act, a friend who wanted to buy Pikachu went to the Mandy store first, and then went to the gashapon store, who had better luck. Then we worked in groups, one group went to Kapok, another group went to Good Smile, and I went to Lingbang. When I arrived outside the Lingbang store, I found that the queue was full\u0026hellip;\n My spell is back to the flash drive\n I sat with two friends outside the second gate, waiting for everyone to arrive. In about a few minutes, let them tell us to eat first and go to a restaurant that two people think is not bad:\n This is the invoice and easy tap\n  Miso Ramen\n  Also Miso Ramen\n When they returned to the second door, they had already bought McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and animation merchandise. So after eating McDonald\u0026rsquo;s there, I went to Taipei Station to order a drink, and then walked away.\n End This is the above notes and experience!\n","permalink":"https://amirvincent64.github.io/en/posts/2021-02-05-notes-taipei-international-comics-and-animation-festival/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRecord the experience and experience of going to the 2021 Taipei International Animation Festival\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"2021 Taipei International Animation Festival-Notes"},{"content":"A tutorial about how to install and deploy your Hugo site on Github Pages\nInstall Hugo \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo;  Homebrew and MacPorts, package managers for macOS, can be installed from brew.sh or macports.org respectively.
