[{"content":"Record the experience and experience of going to the 2021 Taipei International Animation Festival\n Translated by Google, original posts here: Original  1 In the morning, my friend and I met at a breakfast shop. After having breakfast, we went out through the MRT gate and saw a crowd of people surrounding the entire venue. . We walked by the man-made wall and asked a person who was standing in line about the direction of the line. At this moment, it was almost ten o\u0026rsquo;clock in the morning, and we were guided to wait in line outside the main entrance (area 13-D). On the stalled team, friends sat down together, one of them was chasing \u0026ldquo;Goblin Slayer\u0026rdquo;, the others were playing games. During this period, I saw students ordering Foodpanda, workers eating lunch on another shelter, and some cos \u0026ldquo;Re: Life in a Different World from Zero\u0026rdquo; Rem and \u0026ldquo;Wolf Game\u0026rdquo; Iida Rentaro. It took about half an hour before someone gradually moved, and my friends began to prepare to order McDonald\u0026rsquo;s. This is the scene at the time:\n Are there too many people! ! !\n  2 (About an hour later)\nAt that time, I thought that the entrance was the venue, and when I entered:\n You have to row inside! ! !\n Not only that, but the number of people on the second floor gradually increased.\n (There are too many kapok rows, right)\n  3 (After queuing for nearly four hours)\nFinally arrived at the venue. The first thing we entered was not to grab the lucky bag immediately, but to walk around the whole venue first. These were taken while shopping:\n One Piece\n  Compared with Good Smile!\n  Lots of people\n  Hanako-kun! ! ! Hui Ye! ! !\n  I also saw a big drawing board, but unfortunately I didn’t get it\nOf course there must be ghosts, hatsune, JOJO, guinea pigs\nChildren only watch the Blade of Ghost Slayer, adults watch Guinea Pigs\n  4 I walked the whole venue and sat by the wall with my friends. I looked at them for a while and wanted to say why I went to Kapok to buy a slime bag before I started buying a lucky bag. When I came back and waited until my friend started to act, a friend who wanted to buy Pikachu went to the Mandy store first, and then went to the gashapon store, who had better luck. Then we worked in groups, one group went to Kapok, another group went to Good Smile, and I went to Lingbang. When I arrived outside the Lingbang store, I found that the queue was full. . . . . . \u0026gt; My spell is back to the flash drive I sat with two friends outside the second gate, waiting for everyone to arrive. In about a few minutes, let them tell us to eat first and go to a restaurant that two people think is not bad: \u0026gt; This is the invoice and easy tap \u0026gt; Miso Ramen \u0026gt; Also Miso Ramen When they returned to the second door, they had already bought McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and animation merchandise. So after eating McDonald\u0026rsquo;s there, I went to Taipei Station to order a drink, and then walked away. \u0026mdash; # End This is the above notes and experience!
